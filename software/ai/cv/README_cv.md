# Computer Vision

## The computer vision section can be considered as an attempt to replicate the Heads Up Display(HUD) which gets activated when the faceplate of the helmet shuts.

### following functions need to be implemented

- Face Detection :
    - to detect human faces
    - display the estimated age
    - gender
    - total count of persons within the vision
- Face REcognition
    - to match the detected faces against the database
    - greet the recognised face automatically
- Eye Tracking
    - to put focus on the area which the user is gazing at
- Object detection
    - to enumerate a certain type of object around
- Visual question answering
    - ask questions about the surrounding like 'what color is my tshirt'

<!-- - Expression recognition -->
<!-- - Hand gesture recognition -->
