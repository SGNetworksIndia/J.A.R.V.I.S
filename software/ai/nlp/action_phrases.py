"""
consists of intents and the responses for actionable phrases

Actionable phrases are phrases on which jarvis needs to take some action rather than just conversing.

This section has to be hard coded for responses and their intents as they perform specific actions.
Therefore, the more the alternatives to responses and intents, the better JARVIS will perform. Be as verbose as possible.
for intents --> suffix with "_i"
for responses --> suffix with "_r"

if the action has intermediate conversations, the secondary suffix should denote the level
example:
greet_i=["hello"]
greet_r=["hi how are you"]
greet_i2=["i am fine"]
greet_r2=["how's your day going"]
